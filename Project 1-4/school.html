        <h2>My Education</h2>
        <h3>Some Backgroud...</h3>
        <p>
            I attended UCLA for undergrad from 2014-2018. In the beginning
            I really struggled to adjust to the new environment since I was the
            first in my family to ever attend a four year university. There 
            were many challenges I faced going into this portion of my life.
            It was the first time ever that I was required to be responsible for my own
            learning outcomes and adhere to some sort of personal accountability.
            It wasn't easy and there were many classes that challenged me to a point 
            that I was unable to handle. I had originally planned
            on studying and majoring in the physical sciences but eventually settled
            on majoring in political science. After learning many lessons in and out
            of the lecture hall, I ultimately prevailed and graduated 
            in the summer of 2018. Since then I had always wanted to pursue a career in
            programming but never had the time to enroll in traditional schooling since I
            was working and building a recording studio business. At the beginning of 2023
            I was made aware that Cerritos College had a programming program that was
            entirely online, so I enrolled. I'm currently in the middle of a 1 year programming Associates
            program that will help me build a foundation for my future profession in the tech industry.
